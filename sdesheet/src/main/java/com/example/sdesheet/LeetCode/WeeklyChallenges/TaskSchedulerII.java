/*
    You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers tasks, representing tasks that need to be completed in order, where tasks[i] represents the type of the ith task.

    You are also given a positive integer space, which represents the minimum number of days that must pass after the completion of a task before another task of the same type can be performed.

    Each day, until all tasks have been completed, you must either:

    Complete the next task from tasks, or
    Take a break.
    Return the minimum number of days needed to complete all tasks.

    Input: tasks = [1,2,1,2,3,1], space = 3
    Output: 9
    Explanation:
    One way to complete all tasks in 9 days is as follows:
    Day 1: Complete the 0th task.
    Day 2: Complete the 1st task.
    Day 3: Take a break.
    Day 4: Take a break.
    Day 5: Complete the 2nd task.
    Day 6: Complete the 3rd task.
    Day 7: Take a break.
    Day 8: Complete the 4th task.
    Day 9: Complete the 5th task.
    It can be shown that the tasks cannot be completed in less than 9 days.

    Input: tasks = [5,8,8,5], space = 2
    Output: 6
    Explanation:
    One way to complete all tasks in 6 days is as follows:
    Day 1: Complete the 0th task.
    Day 2: Complete the 1st task.
    Day 3: Take a break.
    Day 4: Take a break.
    Day 5: Complete the 2nd task.
    Day 6: Complete the 3rd task.
